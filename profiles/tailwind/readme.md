## Tailwind Profile

The Tailwind profile sets up all necessary files needed to get started with a build pipeline that uses tailwindcss, webpack, postcss and babel to process your Javascript and CSS. A folder "rockfrontendtailwind" will be installed inside `site/templates`. Also a file "_main.php" will be installed to `site/templates`. It contains the minimal setup to load the compiled assets.

### Initial setup
1. rename `site/templates/rockfrontendtailwind/.env-default` to `site/templates/rockfrontendtailwind/.env`
2. Open a terminal inside `site/templates/rockfrontendtailwind`
3. install dependencies: `npm install`

### Usage 

- watch files: `npm run watch`
- build for production: `npm run build`
